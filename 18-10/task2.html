                <p>The soft morning light calling us to the day, the comforting smell of rain (there's a lovely word for
                    it—petrichor), the glory of a sunset—nature has a way of calling us back, however far we may stray.
                    This collection of nature quotes reminds us to revel in it, to be restored by it, to protect it, and
                    ultimately, that it is us who must obey it rather than the other way around (you were a wise one,
                    Francis Bacon).

                    You might commune with nature through gardening (the health benefits are many!) or by embarking on a
                    hike (check out our definitive list of best U.S. hikes). Perhaps you grab a moment when you can to
                    feel the sun on your face and catch a few refrains of birdsong—in fact, that’s a good idea right
                    now, as you meditate on these quotes about nature by poets, authors, artists, scientists,
                    naturalists, and philosophers.</p>
