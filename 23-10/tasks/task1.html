            <span >to Use Inline Styles</span>
            Using inline styles is not considered best practice, though, because it results in a lot of repetition â€“
            because
            the styles cannot be reused elsewhere.

            But there are times when inline styles are the best (or only) option, such as when styling HTML e-mail, CMS
            content like WordPress, Drupal, and so on. You can also use them when styling dynamic content, which is
            HTML-created or changed by JavaScript.

            With the exception of the !important declaration, inline styles have a high specificity/highest priority,
            which
            means they will override most other rules in internal and external stylesheets.

            Assume we have two paragraph texts with inline styling set to red and internal styling set to green:

            The CSS from our inline styles will override the CSS from the internal styling, so both paragraphs will be
            red.

            Advantages and Disadvantages of Inline styles
            So far, we've learned what inline style is and how to use it within HTML tags. Now, let's look at the
            advantages
            and disadvantages to see when we should use inline styles and when we shouldn't.

            Advantages of Inline CSS:
            Inline takes precedence over all other styles. Any styles defined in the internal and external style sheets
            are
            overridden by inline styles.
            You can quickly and easily insert CSS rules into an HTML page, which is useful for testing or previewing
            changes
            and performing quick fixes on your website.
            There is no need to create an additional file.
            To apply styling in JavaScript, use the style attribute.
