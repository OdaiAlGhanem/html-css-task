                Using inline styles is not<span>best practice,</span>  though, because it results in a lot of repetition –
                because
                the styles cannot be reused elsewhere.

                But there are times when inline styles are the best (or only) option, such as when styling HTML e-mail,
                CMS
                content like WordPress, Drupal, and so on. You can also use them when styling dynamic content, which is
                HTML-created or changed by JavaScript.

                With the exception of the !important declaration, <span>best practice,</span> inline styles have a high specificity/highest
                priority,
                which
                means they will override most other rules in internal and<span style="background-color: yellow;">best practice,</span>  external stylesheets.

                Assume we have two paragraph texts with inline styling set to red and internal styling set to green:

                The CSS from our inline styles will override the CSS from the internal styling, so both paragraphs will
                be
                red.

                Advantages and Disadvantages of Inline styles
                So far, we've learned what inline style is and how to use it within HTML tags. Now, let's look at the
                advantages
                and disadvantages to see when we should use inline styles and when we shouldn't.
